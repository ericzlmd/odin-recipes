   <p> Chicken adobo is inherently easyâ€”even the most classic, most authentic recipes are all about ease because the
      dish simply is, well, simple! </p>

   <!-- Add ingredients -->
   <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vinegar (apple cider or white wine)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce (optional)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>Steamed rice</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro or scallions for garnish</li>
      <li>Lime wedges for serving</li>
   </ul>

   <!-- Add instructions -->
   <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), garlic, black pepper, and salt.
         Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or
         up to 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from
         the marinade, letting any excess liquid drip off. Add the chicken to the pot and cook until browned on all
         sides, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
      <li>In the same pot, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the grated ginger and cook, stirring constantly,
         for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Add the bay leaves, vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce (if using), and chicken broth to the pot. Stir to combine,
         scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.</li>
      <li>Return the chicken to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer,
         uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 20-25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool slightly. Remove the bay leaves and serve the chicken and sauce
         over steamed rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro or scallions and serve with lime wedges on the side.</li>
   </ol>
